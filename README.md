LEST aims to connect local producers with vendors to promote sustainable and ethical sourcing of products and create a more diverse market.

## Motivation & Problem Definition

### Introduction

The world is becoming increasingly connected, and the need for sustainable and ethical sourcing of products is on the rise. In response to this trend, our project aims to provide a platform that connects local producers with vendors. We recognize that there is a significant gap in the market for a platform that caters to all local producers, not just those in the agricultural sector. By addressing this gap, we hope to encourage the consumption of locally sourced products and promote a sustainable, ethical, and diverse market for both producers and vendors.

### Problem Definition

The current supply chain for local producers is fragmented and inefficient. The vast majority of local producers lack the necessary resources to connect with vendors, leading to limited access to the market and the inability to compete with larger suppliers. Additionally, local producers face significant barriers when trying to access the market, including high marketing costs, limited distribution networks, and a lack of access to financial resources.

Vendors, on the other hand, struggle to identify and connect with local producers due to the fragmented nature of the market. The process of identifying and verifying local producers is time-consuming, which results in limited vendor options for consumers. Furthermore, vendors face high transaction costs, such as transportation, insurance, and storage, which can make it difficult to offer locally sourced products at competitive prices.

Often, local producers face several challenges, including:

- Limited Market Access: Small-scale producers have limited access to markets, especially those who do not have the resources to invest in marketing and distribution.
- Unequal Bargaining Power: Local producers often have limited bargaining power when negotiating with larger vendors or buyers, leading to unfair pricing and payment terms.
- High Distribution Costs: The cost of distribution can be prohibitively high for small-scale producers, especially those in rural areas.
- Limited Brand Recognition: Local producers often struggle to build their brands and create a recognizable identity in the market, which can limit their ability to attract customers.

On the other hand, vendors face their own set of challenges, including:

- Limited Access to Local Products: Many vendors are not aware of local producers or have limited access to their products, leading to a limited range of locally produced goods for customers.
- Limited Information on Producers: Vendors may have limited information on local producers, including their production methods, certifications, and availability, which can make it difficult to establish trust and build long-term relationships.
- Time and Resource Constraints: Vendors often have limited time and resources to research and engage with local producers, especially when they have multiple product lines and suppliers.
- Overall, the lack of an efficient and accessible platform to connect local producers with vendors creates a barrier to the growth of local agriculture and limits the availability of locally produced goods for consumers.

### Motivation

Our project aims to address the inefficiencies in the current supply chain by providing a platform that connects local producers with vendors. By connecting local producers with vendors, we hope to promote a sustainable and diverse market for both producers and vendors. Our platform will enable local producers to access a larger market, which will lead to increased revenue and greater economic stability. Vendors will benefit from a more efficient supply chain, which will enable them to offer locally sourced products at competitive prices. Additionally, our platform will allow vendors to easily identify and verify local producers, enabling them to offer a more diverse range of locally sourced products to consumers.

Our project's goal is to create a platform that promotes sustainable and ethical sourcing of products, supports the growth of local businesses, and contributes to the economic development of communities. By addressing the inefficiencies in the current supply chain, we hope to create a more sustainable and diverse market that benefits both local producers and vendors.
